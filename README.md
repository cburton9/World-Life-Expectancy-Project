# Project: World Life Expectancy Analysis (Exploratory Data Analysis)

 This project aimed to gain insights into life expectancy patterns and its relationship with various factors using a dataset named world_life_expectancy.

**Key Insights:**

__**Life Expectancy Trends:**__ 
- The script identified countries with the greatest increase in life expectancy over time, potentially indicating positive health trends. 
- It also calculated average life expectancy by year, allowing for observation of general trends across the entire dataset.

**Life Expectancy vs. Other Factors:**
- **GDP:** The analysis explored the correlation between a country's GDP and its average life expectancy. This might reveal potential links between economic development and life expectancy. The script also compared life expectancy in high- vs. low-GDP countries (based on a chosen threshold).
- **BMI:** The script investigated the relationship between a country's average BMI and its life expectancy, providing clues about how body mass index might influence life expectancy across different populations.
- **Development Status:** The analysis compared life expectancy between developed and developing countries, offering insights into potential differences based on a country's development level.

**Adult Mortality (for 'United' Countries):**
- This specific analysis focused on countries named "United" (e.g., United States, United Kingdom). 
- It calculated a rolling total of adult mortality alongside life expectancy for each year within these countries. This allows for visualization of how adult mortality accumulates over time in these specific nations.


Overall, this exploratory data analysis provided a foundation for further investigation into life expectancy and its influencing factors.
